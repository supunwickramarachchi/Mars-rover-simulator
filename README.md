# 🤖 Mars Rover Simulator (GUI + CLI)

A smart simulation of a Mars Rover system with both Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Python. This project includes obstacle avoidance, terrain mapping, undo/reset functions, and command logging — just like in a real mission!

## 🚀 About the Project

This simulator is part of my self-learning journey toward becoming a software engineer in the space, robotics, and aerospace fields. I developed this to demonstrate:

- 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- 🗺️ 2D grid-based movement with obstacle detection
- 🔄 Undo/reset system using state history
- 🖥️ GUI design (Tkinter)
- 🧾 Command logging with timestamps
- ✅ Python file/project structuring
- 🛠️ Real-world software practices

## 🖼️ Features

- GUI controls (MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT, STATUS)
- Real-time status updates
- Visual Mars terrain map
- CLI version for terminal lovers
- Log file for command history (great for debugging)
- Designed for extension into robotics simulation or embedded control

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- datetime and os (for logging)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Building real-world Python apps beyond tutorials
- Applying OOP principles in simulations
- Designing intuitive GUIs with Tkinter
- Logging and managing application state
- Structuring Python projects professionally

## ✨ My Mission
I’m a self-driven software engineer aiming to contribute to aerospace, robotics, and advanced space missions. I built this project from scratch to learn and showcase my ability to design mission-critical software systems. I am open to internships, remote collaborations, and visa-sponsored opportunities.

_Let’s build the future together! 🌌🚀_
